## Overview

eCardnomics is a **desktop flashcard application to quickly create, manage, and access new flashcards via a Command
 Line Interface (CLI)**. eCardnomics is targeted at economics students in Junior College in Singapore, and aims to
 enhance studentsâ€™ study experience as an efficient and handy aid for active recall. 

The application is structured in an inherently organised manner, with three different main modes and clear actions
 within each mode. Students create and tag decks of flash cards in Normal Mode, add individual flash cards in Deck
  Mode, and test their mastery of the flash card material in Game Mode. 
  
The main goals of this application are to help students store and segment their economics subject syllabus into
 different decks, consolidate bite-sized information within each topic by way of flash cards, and offer a fun
  way for students to study and revise.

* Refine Help commands
* JUnit Tests for Game Mode

### Enhancements implemented

In v1.0, I split the work with Wayne in implementing the Deck Mode commands. Specifically, I implemented:

* [DeleteCommand](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T14-2/tp/commit/4f52a8d8aa29b3dbe61442f4eaf3117bf3f1c9ac)
* [HelpCommand](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T14-2/tp/commit/622e584ff2847c15877375fd05a3c7db60bc9858)

`DeleteCommand` required me to implement a `y/n` prompt method for the `Ui` class, to be used by `DeckParser`, which
 was later used by all commands in the application that utilise `y/n` prompts. Below is an example of the user-interface appearance of the `y/n` prompt:
  
```java
[Deck - market failure]
  > delete 2
// Do you want to delete the following flash card? [y/n] ?
//   'What is a public good?' definitely
// Response should be 'y' or 'n'!
//   > y
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// The following flash card has been deleted:
//   'What is a public good?'
// ------------------------------------------------------------
```

In v2.0, I implemented the [Game Mode feature](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T14-2/tp/pull/94). For this, our team originally thought it would be just another command
 implemented as part of Normal Mode or Deck Mode, but I felt it deserved its own mode, and would better fit into the
  design and architecture of the application, as well as the semantics of the Game Mode. Thus I created a separate
   package, [`game`](), and parser class `GameParser` for Game Mode, with the `game` package abstracting away the
    entire Game Mode implementation from the rest of the application.
    
So the resulting `game` package is structured as such:

> `game`
>   > `Game`
>   
>   > `GameEngine`
>   >   > `runGameLoop()`, `update()`
>
>   > `GameStorage`
>   >   > `Deck originalDeck`, `ArrayDeque<FlashCard> deque`, `ArrayList<FlashCard> retestStore`

Here, I tried as much as possible to incorporate the Single Responsibility Principle, both within the `game` classes
, as well as preserving the SRP-ness of the existing classes.

#### Extracts

##### Guide format

Words in `<>` are parameters or additional input to be supplied by the user. 

> Example: `edit <index>`
> 
> Here, `index` is a parameter supplied by the user, in this case to specify a deck index to enter edit mode for.

Commented-out lines `//` represent system output by the program.

> Example:
> ``` 
> add
> // Enter question: <question description>
> // Enter answer: <question answer or explanation>
> ```
> Notice how `<question description>` is still commented out but still represents user input. In other words
>, `<>` can be thought of as being delimiters in output representation across this guide.

Words in square brackets `[]` represent optional input parameters.

> Example: list [/ans]

##### v1.0 Normal Mode commands example - `create`

###### Create a new deck: `create`

Creates a new deck of flashcards. The `create` command expects one argument specifying the name of the deck to be
 created.

###### Format

Create deck without tags:
```java
create <name of deck>
```
Create deck with tag(s):
```java
create <name of deck> [/tag <tag1> [<tag2>]]
```

###### Examples

```
[Normal]
  > create market-failure
// New deck created: market-failure
```
```
[Normal]
  > create market-failure /tag beginner
// New deck created: market-failure | Tag(s): beginner 
```

##### v1.0 Deck Mode commands example - `add`

###### Add a flashcard: `add`
Adds a flashcard to the end of the current deck. The `add` command expects no initial arguments. Instructions and 
format of card entry is displayed. Then, the user is prompted to specify the details of the flashcard to be added.

###### Format
```java
  > add
// Enter question: <question description>
// Enter answer: <question answer or explanation>
```

###### Examples

```java
[Deck - market failure]
     > add 
// Enter question: <question description>
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// You are now adding a FlashCard to: market failure
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Enter question:
     > define market failure
// Enter answer:
     > Market failure is the economic situation defined by an inefficient distribution of goods 
and services in the free market
// FlashCard successfully added! 
// ------------------------------------------------------------ 
```

##### v2.0 Deck Mode commands - `start`

###### Game Mode: `start`

Starts Game Mode for the current deck. 
 
> The `start` command can also be entered from within Normal Mode.
 
###### Format

```java
[Deck - market-failure]
  > start
```

###### Examples

```java
// You are now in Deck Mode, editing: [1] market-failure
// ------------------------------------------------------------
[Deck - market-failure]
  > ...
// ...
// ------------------------------------------------------------
[Deck - market-failure]
  > start
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Welcome to Game Mode!
//
// In this mode, you test your knowledge against...
// ... 
//                                      ...Have fun!
//
// Game Mode is started for: [1] market-failure
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Q: What is market failure?
//   Enter your attempt below (or `done`, `exit`, `help`):
  >
```

##### Features - Game Mode

##### Gameplay

Questions are displayed in a randomised order. At each question, the user will:

1. Try to attempt an answer at the question, by typing at the prompt; then
2. Press `<enter>` (optionally with an empty attempt).

Then, the correct answer is displayed, and our 'advanced' algorithm scores the user's attempt against the correct
 answer. Finally, the user is given the option to re-attempt the question later. See below for example gamplay.
 
###### Examples

* Start Game Mode (from within Deck Mode)

```java
[Deck - Micro-Economics]
  > list
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// You are now viewing deck: Micro-Economics
// 1. Question: What is the Law of demand?
// 
// 2. Question: What is the Law of supply?
//
// 3. Question: What is price elasticity of demand?
//
// 4. Question: What is price elasticity of supply?
// ------------------------------------------------------------
[Deck - Micro-Economics]
  > start
```

* Play!

```java
// ...
// Game Mode is started for: [1] Micro-Economics
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Q: What is the Law of supply?
//   Enter your attempt below (or `done`, `exit`, `help`):
   > Price of good increases, quantity supplied increases.
// A: When the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied increases, ceteris paribus.
// The % match between your answer and the actual answer is: 53.85

#### Extracts

##### Design - Commands section

![DG-Design Commands UML](../images-dg/DG-Design-Commands.png?raw=true "Commands UML Class Diagram")

**API**: [seedu.ecardnomics/command](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu
/ecardnomics/command)

Commands are primarily classified into three categories, `NormalCommand`, `DeckCommand`, and `GameCommand`,
 corresponding to the application's Normal, Deck, and Game Modes, respectively. All three are abstract children
  derived from the overarching abstract class `Command`. The basis `Command` class is defined as such:
   
```java
public abstract class Command {
    public abstract void execute();
}
```

It only requires that all derived children implement the `execute()` method. The only two classes not belonging to
 individual modes are `ExitCommand` and `VoidCommand`. The former is so that users can call the command `exit` from
  anywhere in the application, while the latter is a catch-all "command" for all erroneous commands a user enters. 
   
The `Parser` classes play important roles in execution of specific commands, e.g. `CreateCommand`, because
 they define methods that check and ensure the conformity of user input to the commands' expected input. Below is a
  sequence diagram showcasing this interaction, for execution of a `CreateCommand`, e.g. `create
   microeconomics`:
  
![DG-Design CreateCommand Sequence UML](../images-dg/DG-Design-Sequence-Diagram.png?raw=true "CreateCommand UML
 Sequence Diagram")

##### Feature Implementation - Game Mode

eCardnomics' quintessential mode. Game Mode can be started from either Normal Mode or Deck Mode. The `start` command
 is parsed by `NormalParser` (see [Commands](../DeveloperGuide.md#commands)).
 
Game Mode contains two main components: a storage component, `GameStorage`, and a logic component, `GameEngine`. The
 former handles all data structures used by Game Mode, and stores the original deck (`originalDeck`), question pool
  (`deque`), and retest question pool (`retestStore`). The latter executes the main game loop (`runGameLoop()`), and
   interacts with `GameStorage` on package-private basis; i.e., `GameEngine` and `GameStorage` have full mutual
    access as if they were a single class. This is one of the main intentional design decisions.

**See also**: [Gameplay description](../UserGuide.md#gameplay)

The actual "game" aspect of eCardnomics is essentially summarised in the `runGameLoop()` high-level overview above
. For a textual gameplay description, check out the "See also" link.

The following elaborates the execution flow of Game Mode, from after a `start` command has been parsed in Normal Mode:
