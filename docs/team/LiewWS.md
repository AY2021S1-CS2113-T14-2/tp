## Overview

eCardnomics is a **desktop flashcard application to quickly create, manage, and access new flashcards via a Command
Line Interface (CLI)**. While it is mainly targeted at Junior College economics students, eCardnomics can be used
by anyone who would need to keep track of large amounts of *text-based* information. This is facilitated by the 
capabilities to group similar flashcards into decks and tag decks to provide a summary of the information contained
in the deck. Furthermore, the game mode and the feature of exporting decks into powerpoint allow review of the 
help theinformation to user to memorize the text data.
