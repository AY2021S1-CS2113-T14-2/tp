# User Guide

## Introduction

eCardnomics is a **desktop flashcard application to quickly create, manage, and access new flashcards via a Command
 Line Interface (CLI)**. eCardnomics is targeted at economics students in Junior College in Singapore, and aims to
 enhance studentsâ€™ study experience as an efficient and handy aid for active recall. Through the ability to create
 multiple decks of flashcards and tag them independently, students can segment the subject syllabus into topics when
 managing flashcards, yet consolidate flashcards by topic when accessing them to study.

## Preliminaries

### Installation

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest _jar_ release of `eCardnomics` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T14
-2/tp/releases).

> Java 11 and above is highly recommended, although eCardnomics might run on a lower version.

### Running the program

Open your command line or terminal and navigate to the folder (e.g., `~/downloads`) where you downloaded the jar file
. Then simply run the command `java -jar tp.jar`:

```batch
$ cd ~/downloads
$ ls 
tp.jar
$ java -jar tp.jar
```

> Note: You can also run eCardnomics by double clicking the `tp.jar` file directly.

### Guide format

Words in `<>` are parameters or additional input to be supplied by the user. 

> Example: `edit <index>`
> 
> Here, `index` is a parameter supplied by the user, in this case to specify a deck index to enter edit mode for.

Commented-out lines `//` represent system output by the program.

> Example:
> ``` 
> add
> // Enter question: <question description>
> // Enter answer: <question answer or explanation>
> ```
> Notice how `<question description>` is still commented out but still represents user input. In other words
>, `<>` can be thought of as being delimiters in output representation across this guide.

Words in square brackets `[]` represent optional input parameters.

> Example: list [/ans]

## Features - Normal Mode

[Deck - market failure]
  > list /ans
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// You are now viewing deck: [Deck - market failure]

//    Answer:   Economic situation defined by inefficient

//              and free-riding?
//    Answer:   Free-loading gives a benefit to the free-loader
//              but there is a cost to the people taken
//              advantage of. Free-riding is an advantage to
